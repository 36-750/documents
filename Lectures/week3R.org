  - Challenges are posted (or will be shortly). There are four challenges
    available:

    | Challenge           | Summary                                                    |
    |---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
    | anomaly-speed       | Use anomaly detection in videos to track objects           |
    | autocomplete-me     | Autocomplete user queries from massive database of options |
    | classification-tree | Build classification trees and use them to classify data   |
    | shazam              | Automatically recognize music                              |

    The Challenge schedule is:

    |  Part | Description                          | Due    |
    |-------+--------------------------------------+--------|
    |     1 | Design and testing                   | Oct 2  |
    |     2 | Basic implementation                 | Oct 23 |
    |     3 | Advanced features                    | Nov 13 |
    |     4 | Extension and interoperation         | Dec 4  |
    | Final | Final revisions based on TA comments | Dec 13 |

    You may submit a challenge part before the due date, but you should wait for
    TA feedback before submitting the next part.

    (Not all Parts are completely written in the challenges; we'll update them
    as the semester advances.)

    As usual, grading is mastery-based: the TAs will leave comments and
    suggestions and expect you to revise your code as needed. You must revise
    each part by *at least one week* before the next part is due.

    The Challenge is required. You must Master all four parts to pass the
    course.

    You should look at the Challenges and pick your favorite soon; if you'd like
    advice on which Challenge would suit your goals, just ask. You won't be able
    to switch Challenges after you've submitted your first Challenge part.

    Peer review will be a required part of the Challenges.

  - I have posted new assignments today, about data structures.

  - Next Tuesday: design and data structures activities in class. Be sure to
    bring your laptops.
