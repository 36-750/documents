  1. What does this represent?  =cochoice : (Either a c -> Either c b) -> a -> b=

     #+begin_src idris
       cochoice : (Either a c -> Either b c) -> a -> b
       cochoice f = go . Left
         where
           go : Either a c -> b
           go eac =
             case f eac of
               Left b -> b
               Right c -> go (Right c)
     #+end_src

  2. =fix= and the Z-combinator

     Eager fix:
     #+begin_src python
       def fix(f):
           "The Z-combinator for finding fixed points in an eager language."
           def z(u):
               return f(lambda x: u(u)(x))
           return z(z)
     #+end_src

     /Lazy/ fix:
     #+begin_src haskell
       fix : (a -> a) -> a
       fix f = 
           let x = f x 
            in x
     #+end_src

     What does this mean? Try =fix identity=.  It fails....

     Choose a different type for =a=:
     #+begin_src haskell
       fix : ((b -> c) -> b -> c) -> b -> c

       cosF x =
         fix (\f b -> 
                 if cos b == b 
                  then b
                  else f (cos b)
              ) x

       last : List a -> Maybe a
       last [] = Nothing
       last [x] = Some x
       last (x :: xs) = last xs

       lastF = fix $ \recurse xs ->
           case xs of
               [] -> 
                   Nothing
               [x] -> 
                   Just x
               (x :: xs) -> 
                   recurse xs

       map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
       map _ [] = []
       map f (x :: xs) = f x :: map f xs
        
       mapF f = fix $ \recurse list ->
           case list of
               [] -> []
               (x :: xs) -> f x :: recurse xs
     #+end_src
