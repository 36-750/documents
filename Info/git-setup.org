#+TITLE: Setting Up Git

Here we collect some tips on setting up and using Git.

First, you need Git to know your name and email address:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global user.name   "Alex Reinhart"
  git config --global user.email  "areinhar@stat.cmu.edu"
#+END_SRC

* The default editor

  Git, by default, will open Vim to edit commit messages. You can adjust this.
  See =text-editors.org= in this folder for more about text editors.

  On Windows in Git Bash, you can easily have it open Notepad instead:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git config --global core.editor notepad
  #+END_SRC

  If you use an editor with Git support built in, like Atom or Visual Studio
  Code, you can use the editor's buttons and menus to make commits.
