1. For Mac and Linux users, open a terminal. Windows users can
   start git-bash.

2. Log into the new department database server, sculptor.stat.cmu.edu,
   via ssh using the username and password Carl sent you in email.

     ssh yourusername@sculptor.stat.cmu.edu

   You'll be asked for your password. Type it (the letters won't show
   up), then hit Enter and you should be logged in. If it asks "are
   you sure you want to continue connecting?", say yes. (You should
   probably change your password by tying 'passwd' at the shell
   prompt and entering a new password.)

3. At the shell prompt, type

     psql

   which will start an interactive postgresql REPL.
   You should now see a prompt like 'yourusername# '.

   If you want to run shell commands (like ls or cp) you'll have to exit psql
   first, since it only understands SQL commands.

4. Work in postgres. To quit psql, type \q at the prompt. 

   Note that you're sending commands to be run on the server, not on your own
   computer. If, for example, you want to load a file of SQL commands which you
   have stored on your own computer, you can't simply write

     \i /Users/yourname/Computing/file.sql

   because the command is run on the server, and the server doesn't have any
   file with that name.

   Files for the dealing-with-CRUD and sfn assignments have been uploaded to the
   server under the /home/areinhar directory, e.g.
   /home/areinhar/player-stats.sql. You will have to use this path to load them.

5. To upload a file to the server, you can use the scp command. For example,

     scp some-file-on-your-computer.sql yourusername@scultor.stat.cmu.edu:~/

   will copy some-file-on-your-computer.sql to the server, in your home
   directory. You would then be able to load it in psql with

     \i some-file-on-your-computer.sql

6. Mac users with homebrew installed might want to install postgresql locally
   instead. (This is optional, and would let you run commands on your own
   computer instead of sculptor.stat.cmu.edu.) At the shell prompt, do

     brew install postgresql
     initdb -D /usr/local/var/postgres
     pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
     createdb NAME

   where NAME is your username (the word after /Users in your home
   directory path), for simplicity.

7. Windows users may be able to run ssh through git-bash. If not, you will
   need to download PuTTY, a SSH client for Windows. Download =PuTTY.exe=
   from here:
    
      http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
    
   PuTTY users can log in this through the graphical interface, connecting
   to sculptor.stat.cmu.edu and using your username and password; you should see
   a command line prompt once you successfully logged in.
