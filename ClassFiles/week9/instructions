For Mac and Linux users, open a terminal and type

   ssh yourusername@pg.stat.cmu.edu

You'll be asked for your password. Type it (the letters won't show up),
then hit Enter and you should be logged in. If it asks "are you sure you
want to continue connecting?", say yes.

Windows users may be able to do this through git-bash. If not, you will
need to download PuTTY, a SSH client for Windows. Download =PuTTY.exe=
from here:

   http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

PuTTY users can log in this through the graphical interface, connecting
to pg.stat.cmu.edu and using your username and password; you should see
a command line prompt once you successfully logged in.


Mac users with homebrew installed might want to install postgresql locally
instead. Do

      brew install postgresql
      pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
      createdb NAME

where NAME is your username (the word after /Users in your home
directory path), for simplicity.
