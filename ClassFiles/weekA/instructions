1. For Mac and Linux users, open a terminal. Windows users can
   start git-bash.

2. Log into the new department database server, sculptor.stat.cmu.edu,
   via ssh using the username and password Carl sent you in email.

     ssh yourusername@sculptor.stat.cmu.edu

   You'll be asked for your password. Type it (the letters won't show
   up), then hit Enter and you should be logged in. If it asks "are
   you sure you want to continue connecting?", say yes. (You should
   probably change your password by tying 'passwd' at the shell
   prompt and entering a new password.)

3. At the shell prompt, type

     psql

   which will start an interactive postgresql REPL.
   You should now see a prompt like 'yourusername# '.

4. Work in postgres. To quit psql, type \q at the prompt. 


5. Mac users with homebrew installed might want to install postgresql
   locally instead. At the shell prompt, do

     brew install postgresql
     initdb -D /usr/local/var/postgres
     pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
     createdb NAME

   where NAME is your username (the word after /Users in your home
   directory path), for simplicity.


6. Windows users may be able to do this through git-bash. If not, you will
   need to download PuTTY, a SSH client for Windows. Download =PuTTY.exe=
   from here:
    
      http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html
    
   PuTTY users can log in this through the graphical interface, connecting
   to pg.stat.cmu.edu and using your username and password; you should see
   a command line prompt once you successfully logged in.
