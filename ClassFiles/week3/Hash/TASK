#+TITLE: Hash Table Class Activity

For a sequence of words, we define an n-gram, for some integer n to be a
sub-sequence of n successive words from original sequence. We will
represent such an n-gram by a single string (the n-gram key) that joins
the n words with a separator like '+' between them.

The overall task is to process two sources of text (e.g., text files on
the file system or in the cloud) and find the n-grams that they have in
common (along with the maximum number of times each n-gram appears in
both texts).

Each file process.* has code to perform this task.

But one function nGramFrequency() is incomplete. This function is
documented. After looking through the code in the file, you should fill
in the missing code and test your function directly and through the
results of the function nGramIntersection(), which solves the overall
task.

You should also write a function (named as you prefer but in the
same style as the other code) that returns the specified number
of most common n-grams in a document.

In R, note the utility function withReadConnection(), which can be used
as follows:

#+begin_src R
  fooFrequencies <- withReadConnection(file("foo"), nGramFrequency, n=2)
#+end_src
