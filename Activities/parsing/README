Core API
--------
- combinators.py :: Python implementation
- combinators.r  :: R implementation
- test_combinators.py :: pytest tests
- test_combinators.r :: testthat tests

Applications
------------
All of these can be easily converted from one language to another.
The combinator code is almost identical. The support code will
change however. An additional EXERCISE is to implement one of these
in your chosen language when the given implementation is in the
other.

- parse_quotes.r :: Parsing quoted strings with escape sequences
- test_quoted.r :: tests of quoted string parsing
- parse_regexp.py :: Parse regular expressions into a syntax tree
- test_regexp.py :: Tests of reguluar expression parsing
- parse_state_machine.py :: Parse a text specification of state machines
- sm1.txt :: Sample input specification for a state machine
