#+TITLE: Crime Data Team Programming Activity
#+DATE: 27 Oct 2022  Week 8 Thursday

* The Problem

  As municipal police departments modernize how they record and analyze
  data about criminal activity, they are developing (and sharing) software
  systems to manage and analyze their data.

  This problem involves one such system, modeled on the famous CompStat,
  that is being used in several cities across the country, including
  Pittsburgh.

  You regularly (e.g., weekly or daily) receive a data file called
  a *blotter* that lists crimes that occurred duing the last
  time period with associated data describing those crimes.

  Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to add this data,
  automatically "cleaned" into a managed database and provide
  facilities for updating and analyzing the data.

* Requirements

  Tasks:
  1. Initialize/Configure a new system
  2. Handle connecting to and managine a relational database
  3. Ingesting new data
     - Cleaning data automatically (e.g., normalizing neighborhood names)
     - CSV or Excel files as direct input or URL
  4. Patching existing data
     - Cleaning data automatically (e.g., normalizing neighborhood names)
     - Recognizing/ignoring duplicates in patches, recognizing new data and adding it
  5. Generating reports and graphics
     - Table of crimes during a date range, split by crime type and optionally neighborhood
     - Produce table of pre-specified summary statistics by neighborhood and time
     - Detect changes by neighborhood and precinct/zone (in separate tables)
     - Plot totals by a time period and summary statistics over time
  6. Creating data files for downstream analysis
  7. Logging
  8. Updating configuration
