#+TITLE: Queue Activity

In daily life, we often have to ``get in line'' to wait
for service. Two kinds of queueing systems are quite
common. The /grocery store/ system has many servers
(cashiers) each with his or her own individual line.
A customer needs to choose a line and wait. The /passport control/
system has many servers (border agents) with a single
line with all travelers. As an agent becomes available, 
he or she serves the next person in line.

Why would we choose one system over another?
Which version leads to the lowest average waiting times?
Does this comparison depend on the nature of the
random processes governing service and arrival times?

In this task, we will simulate two such queueing systems
to try to answer these questions.

The files queues.* contain code for simulating these systems
in different languages. The functions governing management
of the queues and comparison of the systems are incomplete.
Your task is to fill these in and compare the systems.
Feel free to tweek the parameters of the random processes
in your simulations to get robust results.

You should implement the queues in this code rather than
using a library.
